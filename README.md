# Project Title: Task Manager

A command-line Task Manager application to organize and manage tasks efficiently.

The Task Manager is a C++ program designed to help individuals efficiently organize and manage their tasks. 
It provides a user-friendly command-line interface to create, track, modify, and complete tasks. With features 
such as task storage, filtering, sorting, and reminders, the Task Manager empowers users to stay organized, 
prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines effectively. The primary purpose of the Task Manager program is to demonstrate the implementation and utilization of Arrays, Heaps, Stacks, and Queues in a practical scenario. 


## Features

1. Create Task:
   - Users can create a task by providing a title, description, and deadline.
   
2. Task Storage:
   - Tasks are stored using a linked list data structure.
   
3. Task Listing:
   - All tasks are listed, showing the titles and deadlines.
   - Tasks can be sorted based on the user's chosen criteria, such as by deadline or by name.
   
4. Task Filtering:
   - Users can filter tasks based on criteria such as status, priority, or category.
   
5. Task Modification:
   - Users can update task information, including the title, description, and deadline.
   
6. Task Completion:
   - Users can mark tasks as completed.
   - Each task has an option to toggle the completion status.
   
7. Task Deletion:
   - Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
   
8. Task Reminders (Optional):
   - Provide reminders for upcoming task deadlines.
   - Reminders can be in the form of visual notifications or email notifications.
   
9. Task Search:
   - Users can search for specific tasks based on keywords or categories.
